**Portfolio – Pavithra.PA**

**About the Project**

This personal portfolio website is designed and developed with care using HTML and Tailwind CSS. It reflects who I am — highlighting my introduction, skills, education, internships, and project experiences. The site is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth and engaging experience whether viewed on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.

**My Experience**

Building this portfolio has been an inspiring step in my growth as a web developer. It gave me hands-on experience with Tailwind CSS, helping me design elegant and responsive layouts with utility-first styling. Through this project, I learned how to structure meaningful content, manage clean design elements, and present my work effectively.
Creating this portfolio not only improved my frontend development skills but also gave me a platform to express my passion, creativity, and journey as a budding tech professional.
